      1: Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
    </h1>
    <h1>2: Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.</h1>
    <h1>3:Write a program that calculates the grade based on marks.</h1>
    <h1>4:Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year.</h1>
    <p>
      Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for
      years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are
      leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years
      1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.
